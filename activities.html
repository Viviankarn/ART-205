                <p>To be forgiven is wonderful, but to have a forgivivg heart is the greater grace. Consider what God has done for us. When we are permitted
                    to enter Heaven and enjoy the the manifold blessings of that Celestial City, it will be the result of God's love  for our souls and His 
                    forgiveness of our sins.
